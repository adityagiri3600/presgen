# Fun little algorithm to generate groups from presentations $\langle S | P \rangle$
![klein group example](https://github.com/adityagiri3600/presgen/blob/main/klein_group_example.png?raw=true)
## How it works
At the bare bones level it generates all the valid* words from the set of generators as an alphabet and uses the presentation to simplify juxtaposition (multiplication) of words.
*: deciding what makes a word valid however is an entire thing
